# 2025Q2 Deliveries in within 48 hours Query
These queries counts the number of orders completed or returned in the second quarter of 2025 that were delivered within 48 hours. Also groups the results by year and quarter, using the orders table from the look_ecommerce dataset in order to get aggregations.

## 1st Task:
 * Retrieve unique orders with 'Complete' or 'Returned' status.
 * Calculate the delivery time in hours for each order using the difference between delivered and created dates.
 * Filter for orders with a delivery time of 48 hours or less.
```sql
#Delivery time in hours breakdown by orders_id for the Q22025 period.
select
  format_datetime("%Y-%QQ",created_at)as year_quarter,
  order_id as order_id,
  created_at as created_at,
  delivered_at as delivered_at,
  TIMESTAMP_DIFF(delivered_at,created_at, HOUR) AS delivery_time
from
`bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.orders`
where
  status in ('Complete','Returned') and
  EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM created_at) = 2 and
  extract(YEAR FROM created_at) = 2025 
order by
  created_at asc
```

## 2nd Task:
 * Create a subquery to get agregations.
 * Count the number of orders that meet the criteria from the first task.
 * Group the counts by year and quarter.
```sql
#Delivery time in hours aggregated level for Q22025 period.
select
year_quarter as year_quarter,
count(order_id) as count_order_id,
from
(
select
  format_datetime("%Y-%QQ",created_at)as year_quarter,
  order_id as order_id,
  created_at as created_at,
  delivered_at as delivered_at,
  TIMESTAMP_DIFF(delivered_at,created_at, HOUR) AS delivery_time
from
`bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.orders`
where
  status in ('Complete','Returned') and
  EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM created_at) = 2 and
  extract(YEAR FROM created_at) = 2025 and
  TIMESTAMP_DIFF(delivered_at,created_at, HOUR) <= 48
order by
  created_at asc
)
group by year_quarter
order by year_quarter
```
